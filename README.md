## 🔬 Project Title: Logistic Regression Analysis of Breast Cancer Data 🌸

## 📌 Description:

I'm excited to share my latest project, where I applied Logistic Regression to analyze the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set. This dataset is commonly used in the fields of machine learning and healthcare for diagnostic purposes.

## 📈 Project Highlights:

Preprocessed and explored the dataset.

Utilized Logistic Regression, a powerful classification algorithm.

Achieved an accuracy score of 0.99% in predicting breast cancer diagnosis.

Visualized the results and important features using Python's matplotlib and seaborn libraries.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways:

Logistic Regression is a valuable tool for binary classification tasks.

Understanding breast cancer diagnosis through data analysis can lead to more effective treatments and early detection.
